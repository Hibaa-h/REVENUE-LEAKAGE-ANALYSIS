# Revenue Leakage Analysis & Recovery Strategy

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying, quantifying, and analyzing revenue leakage using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The analysis highlights where revenue is being lost, the key drivers behind leakage, and how effective current recovery mechanisms are, enabling data-driven decisions to improve net revenue and operational efficiency.

## Business Problem
Revenue leakage caused by pricing errors, tax miscalculations, refunds, discount issues, and operational delays can significantly reduce profitability. Without clear visibility into leakage sources and recovery performance, organizations struggle to control losses and optimize financial outcomes.

This project addresses these challenges by providing a structured analytical view of revenue leakage and recovery trends.
